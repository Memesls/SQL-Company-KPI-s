# SQL-Company-KPI-s
SQL data exploration that returns common KPIs needed by a company.

The queries I ran are in the "coffee_shop_sales_db.sql" file. I included comments to improve their readability.
The raw file can also be found as a .csv in the repository files.

In this project, I:

1. Created a database in MySQL.
2. Imported the relevant data to the table.
3. Modified, updated, and altered the column types and format of the data.
4. Calculated the requested KPIs, which are noted below.
5. Added some extra KPIs later used in a Power BI dashboard (not part of this repository).

Required KPIs were:

1. Total Sales Analysis:
  ○ Calculate the total sales for each respective month.
  ○ Determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in sales.
  ○ Calculate the difference in sales between the selected month and the previous month.

2. Total Orders Analysis:
  ○ Calculate the total number of orders for each respective month.
  ○ Determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in the number of orders.
  ○ Calculate the difference in the number of orders between the selected month and the previous month.

3. Total Quantity Sold Analysis:
  ○ Calculate the total quantity sold for each respective month.
  ○ Determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in the total quantity sold.
  ○ Calculate the difference in the total quantity sold between the selected month and the previous month.
